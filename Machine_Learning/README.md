# Machine_Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
It is a subfield of AI that focuses on developing systems that learn or improve performance based on the data they ingest. 
Machine learning algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. 
These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.
