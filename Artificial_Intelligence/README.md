# Artificial_Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. 
AI is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, 
and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. 
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), 
recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), 
self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), 
and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).
